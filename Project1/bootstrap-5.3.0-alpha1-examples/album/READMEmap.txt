The Map Animation project is a map with a marker that is animated. It moves through the stops the bus makes between the Harvard and MIT campuses. The animation starts after clicking the "Show stops" button. The coordinates are in an array and it follows a simple if statement with a counter and a timer set at every 3000ms. You can directly run the page by loading indexmap.html or navigating through the main webpage index.html.
