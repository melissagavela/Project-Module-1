# Project-Module-1 To run this program download the whole folder. Inside the "album" folder run the index.html file to run the main webpage. 
# All the files in the "album" folder are modified or created by me to complete my project.
# The "assets" folder contains coding for the bootstrap-based webpage to run correctly. I used bootstrap to help me out while designing the webpage.
# The "assets" files are untouched by me, all credit goes to bootstrap.
